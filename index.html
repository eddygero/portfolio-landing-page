        <section><h2>ABOUT ME</h2></section>
        <p>As of august 2021, im currently, still a student, just having completed my highschool
            examinations, looking forward to being a great ,<strong>software engineer.</strong>. 
            I am briefly going to explain more about myself, with the help of the following bullet points 
            <ol>
                <li>My background</li>
                <li>My hobbies</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

  <h2>My background</h2>
        <p> I was born, and raised , in <em>Nairobi city</em>, im currently 19
            years old , studying at <a href="http://moringaschool.com" target="_blank">moringa school.</a>
            I completed my highschool education in 2019, at Moi Forces Academy, in Eastleigh ,Nairobi. At primary level, 
            i studied at a school called,Precious Gift Group of schools, located in komarock area, Nairobi.
        </p>
        <p><strong>I decided to study programming, due to the following reason:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming jobs always have been and always will be in demand. 
                    As a society, we are getting more technologically advanced and more digitized.
                     This means that those who can code will always be sought after.
                     Not only does this mean that there is an abundance of jobs, 
                     but it means salaries are high and you will never be out of work.
                     There is particular demand for coders who have experience in specialist sectors such as
                     AI, blockchain, and machine learning.</li>

                <li>Pretty much every country has a need for computer programmers. 
                    From creating code to automating processes and developing new solutions- 
                    programmers are very much needed. If you can code or are learning how to, 
                    your employer will want to keep hold of you. 
                    As the company grows, it can give you the ability to grow with the company, 
                    taking on more tasks and responsibilities moving forward.</li>

                 <li>Programing jobs tend to pay a lot more than other roles. Furthermore, programmers can choose to 
                     work for a company, remotely, on contracts, or as freelancers.
                     There are even consultancy roles where wages are significantly higher.</li>   
            </ul>

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

      I go <em>hiking</em> maybe twice a month to relax and not spend too much money.
      Most weekends, I like to relax at home and spend time with my family.Personally,Iâ€™ve always loved <em>traveling</em> since I was very young, 
      so I try to travel somewhere at least once a month 
      I go to <em>rugby</em> practice twice a week, maybe three times if we have a game.
      Apart from these few things, i also fancy:
       <ol> 
           <li>photography</li>
           <li>Eating out with friends</li>
           <li>writing</li>
           <li>singing</li>
       </ol>
